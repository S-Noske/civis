# An Introduction to (the Sociology) of Systemic Thinking and Ideology

---

## Part 1: What is Systemic Thinking?

* Loose collection of interdisciplinary study fields, ca. 1950

* Some thinkers, such as Niklas Luhman, established their own, 
specific theories of systems, i.e., of society as a set of systems
	* Our next slide presents examples of this

--

* Systemic approaches are opposed to the general epistemological paradigm 
of western science, as established by Descartes’ mind-body dualism 
	* The observer is not distinct from the object, but rather part of the 
	object and imposes a unique perspective on his/her observations
	* Still, systemic thinking is not a paradigm that emerged outside of 
	western scientific tradition and shares a set of its presuppositions

--

* For our purposes: A tool or mental model for addressing questions in the social sciences

* Areas of application: Sociology, biology and ecosystems, 
economics, simulations, ...

## Part 1: Examples of Systems Thinking in the Social Sciences

* Luhmann's Systemic Theory

* Habermas' Theory of Communicative Action

* In terms of their systemic theories, Luhmann and Habermas were in dispute
	* Habermas: Luhmann's theory affirms the status quo of society
	* Luhmann: Habermas' ideas of altruistics and egaliatarian discourse are utopian

## Part 1: A Systemic Thinker's Vocabulary

* Homeostasis

	* Systems maintaining a stable state (example: our body temperature)

--

* Cybernetics
	* The study of (auto-)regulatory systems (trivial example: thermostat)

--

* Cybernetic equivalence and emergence
	* Elements can not be deduced from a system’s behavior, a system's behavior 
	can not be deduced from its elements

--

* Autopoiesis
	* (Natural) systems able to create themselves out of themselves 
	(example: our body [cells], our ecosystem)
* The system "society" is made up by an infinte number of "communications"
---

## Part 1: A Systemic Thinker's Vocabulary


* Chaos theory
	* Linear elements can cause non-linear outcomes in a deterministic fashion

--

* Non-trivial machines
	* Kicking a stone has a less trivial outcome than kicking a dog

--

* Second-order observers
	* The observer is part of the observation, the implications of which can be systematically studied (through observation)

<br>

*We will give you a reading list at the end of our seminar if you are interested*

## Questions and Group Reflection (10 minutes)

Questions to reflect:

* How would you define systemic thinking in your own terms?

* Is systemic thinking scientific thinking?

* Is society actually a system?
	* What are limitations of this conceptualization?

* What is ideology (not)?
